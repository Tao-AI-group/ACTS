## Clinical trial meta data modeling

We have conducted a comprehensive exploration of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) related clinical trials, identifying a total of 3,416 trials. The United States leads with 1,787 trials, followed by France (287) and China (139), reflecting both significant global involvement and regional concentration. We observed that the number of AD-related trials has generally increased over time, peaking with 265 trials in 2023. A majority (79.8%) of these trials are interventional, primarily focusing on drug interventions, with 20.0% being observational studies. We also analyzed the distribution across trial phases, noting that 34.0% of the trials are not phase-specific. From a manual review of 50 selected trials, we identified common formats for outcome measurements, which include efficacy assessments through cognition tests, imaging scans, and various safety and tolerability metrics. Treatment strategies typically involve combinations of experimental drugs with active and placebo comparators, while treatment assignment is organized into randomized and non-randomized models. Follow-up periods are defined by the patient’s first AD diagnosis, loss to follow-up, or a specified time after the baseline measurement. Moving forward, we plan to analyze additional trials to extract and standardize common elements, which will contribute to the development of an AD-related ontology using the Athena OHDSI vocabulary.
