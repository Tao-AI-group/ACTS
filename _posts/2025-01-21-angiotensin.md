## Association Between Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers and Alzheimer’s Disease Risk in Hypertensive Patients

We investigate the potential **protective effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) against Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD)** in individuals with hypertension. Given the **growing global burden of dementia and the lack of curative treatments**, identifying **cost-effective prevention strategies** is of paramount importance. Our large-scale retrospective cohort study leverages **high-volume claims data** to provide **strong evidence that ARBs may reduce ADRD risk compared to other antihypertensive medications (AHMs) and non-users**.

### Key Findings
- **ARB users exhibited a 20% lower hazard of developing ADRD compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) users** (HR=0.80, p<0.0001).
- Compared to non-ARB AHMs, ARB users had a **29% reduced ADRD risk** (HR=0.71, p<0.0001).
- Compared to AHM non-users, ARBs reduced ADRD risk by **18%** (HR=0.82, p<0.0001).
- **Blood-brain barrier (BBB)-permeable ARBs** were associated with **superior neuroprotective effects**, with a **31% lower ADRD risk than AHM non-users** (HR=0.69, p<0.0001).
- The protective effects of ARBs also extended to **vascular dementia (VaD)**, with ARB users showing a **23% lower hazard compared to ACEI users**.

### Methodology
- **Dataset**:
  - Data were sourced from **Optum’s de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart (CDM)**, covering **6,390,826 hypertensive individuals** from 2007-2020.
  - Study groups included **1,839,176 ARB users, 3,366,841 non-ARB AHM users, and 1,184,809 AHM non-users**.
- **Study Design**:
  - We conducted a **retrospective cohort study** comparing ARB users to other hypertensive populations.
  - **Kaplan-Meier survival curves** and **Cox proportional hazards (PH) models** were used to assess ADRD risk.
- **Drug Classification**:
  - ARBs were categorized based on **blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability**, including **BBB-crossing ARBs** (telmisartan, candesartan) and **non-BBB ARBs** (losartan, valsartan).
- **Confounder Adjustments**:
  - The analysis controlled for **demographics, comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, depression, etc.), and medication usage (statins, metformin, etc.)**.

### Evaluation & Results
- **Kaplan-Meier survival analysis** revealed that **ARB users had the lowest cumulative ADRD risk** compared to other antihypertensive medication groups (p<0.0001).
- **BBB-permeable ARBs demonstrated stronger neuroprotection**, reducing ADRD risk by **11% more than non-BBB ARBs** (p<0.0001).
- **Vascular dementia risk reduction was also significant**, with ARB users showing a **25% lower hazard compared to non-ARB AHMs**.

### Implications
We provide **strong evidence that ARBs, particularly those that cross the blood-brain barrier, may serve as an effective preventative strategy against Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia**. These findings highlight:
- **A potential shift in hypertension management strategies** toward favoring ARBs over ACEIs when ADRD prevention is a consideration.
- **The role of blood-brain barrier permeability in drug effectiveness** for cognitive protection.
- **A cost-effective, widely available intervention for dementia prevention** in hypertensive individuals.

### Future Work
- **Prospective clinical trials** to validate the neuroprotective effects of ARBs.
- **Exploring genetic and biomarker-driven approaches** to personalize antihypertensive treatment for ADRD risk reduction.
- **Longitudinal studies assessing ARB effects on cognitive function and dementia progression**.
