## Quantifying the Impact of SNOMED CT Hierarchy Quality on Cohort Queries

We present a **quantitative assessment of how the quality of SNOMED CT’s subtype hierarchy impacts cohort queries in Electronic Health Records (EHRs)**. SNOMED CT serves as a **standardized terminology for structuring clinical concepts**, but **missing and inaccurate is-a relations can significantly reduce recall and precision in patient cohort identification**. Our study introduces **novel metrics to quantify these effects** and provides statistical evidence for their impact.

### Key Findings
- **Missing is-a relations in SNOMED CT significantly reduce recall in cohort queries**, leading to the omission of relevant patient records.
- **Inaccurate is-a relations lower precision**, including irrelevant patient records in query results.
- **Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirm the statistical significance of these effects** (p-value < 0.001).
- **Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeable ARBs demonstrated stronger neuroprotective effects**, reducing ADRD risk by **31% more than AHM non-users** (HR=0.69, p<0.0001).
- Our **impact metrics can guide prioritization of terminology quality improvements** for SNOMED CT maintainers.

### Methodology
- **Dataset**:
  - We analyzed the **Optum de-identified COVID-19 EHR dataset**, comprising **over 7 million unique patient records from 700 hospitals and 7,000 clinics**.
  - **SNOMED CT’s September 2023 US Edition was used**, along with mapped ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes from the **OHDSI Standardized Vocabularies**.
- **Quality Defect Identification**:
  - **407 missing is-a relations** and **48 inaccurate is-a relations** were compiled from prior validated studies.
  - Hierarchical defects were manually confirmed by domain experts, including clinical terminology specialists.
- **Quantitative Metrics**:
  - **Micro-averaged and macro-averaged recall** measured the impact of missing is-a relations.
  - **Micro-averaged and macro-averaged precision** evaluated the effects of inaccurate is-a relations.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - **Wilcoxon signed-rank tests** assessed the significance of recall and precision reductions.

### Evaluation & Results
- **Missing is-a relations significantly lowered recall**:
  - Example: The **"Osteoarthritis of knee" → "Arthritis of knee"** relation was missing, reducing recall to **7.19% (F1-score = 0.87)**.
  - **Wilcoxon test results: p-value < 0.001**, confirming statistical significance.
- **Inaccurate is-a relations reduced precision**:
  - Example: **"Toxic encephalopathy" was incorrectly classified under "Toxic metabolic encephalopathy"**, leading to misclassification of 39,585 patients.
  - **Wilcoxon test results: p-value < 0.001**, indicating significant impact.

### Implications
We demonstrate that **hierarchical defects in SNOMED CT critically affect cohort queries**, highlighting:
- **The need for systematic quality control in biomedical ontologies**.
- **Better terminology curation to ensure high-fidelity patient cohort selection**.
- **Potential biases in clinical research due to errors in medical ontologies**.

### Future Work
- **Extending impact analysis to multi-concept queries** beyond single SNOMED CT terms.
- **Automating error detection using AI-driven approaches** to improve terminology quality.
- **Cross-validation across multiple EHR datasets** to enhance generalizability.
