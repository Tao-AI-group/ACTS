## AI-Powered Model for Accurate Prediction of MCI-to-AD Progression

We introduce an **AI-powered predictive model** for identifying individuals with **mild cognitive impairment (MCI)** who are at risk of progressing to **Alzheimer’s disease (AD)**. Given the growing burden of AD and the **need for early intervention**, our deep learning framework leverages **longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) and claims data** to provide **accurate risk stratification over multiple time horizons**.

### Key Findings
- **BiGRU deep learning model achieved state-of-the-art performance in predicting MCI-to-AD progression**, with an **AUC-ROC of 0.833 and an AUC-PR of 0.856** for a **five-year prediction window**.
- **Temporal modeling of EHRs significantly improved long-term prediction accuracy**, capturing sequential patterns in **diagnoses, medications, and procedures**.
- **Compared to traditional machine learning models (LGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)**, the BiGRU model consistently outperformed across all prediction intervals.
- **Hypertension, depression, and anxiety emerged as strong predictors of MCI progression**, highlighting the role of comorbidities in dementia risk.
- **Our AI model is based on claims data rather than neuroimaging or genetic biomarkers**, making it **scalable and accessible for real-world clinical use**.

### Methodology
- **Dataset**:
  - We utilized **Optum’s de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database (2007-2020)**, containing **80,931 patients with an initial MCI diagnosis**.
  - **Longitudinal patient records, including diagnoses, medications, and procedures**, were analyzed for up to **five years post-MCI diagnosis**.
- **Model Architecture**:
  - We implemented a **Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) deep learning model**, designed to capture **temporal dependencies** in patient health data.
  - The model processes **15-day interval sequences of medical concepts**, including **age, gender, comorbidities, medications, and procedures**.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR), and F1-score**.
  - **Comparison against baseline models**, including **LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression**.

### Evaluation & Results
- **Performance Across Prediction Windows**:
  - **1-year prediction**: BiGRU achieved **AUC-ROC 0.679, AUC-PR 0.122**.
  - **2-year prediction**: BiGRU improved to **AUC-ROC 0.690, AUC-PR 0.274**.
  - **3-year prediction**: BiGRU showed significant gains, with **AUC-ROC 0.751, AUC-PR 0.554**.
  - **5-year prediction**: BiGRU reached **AUC-ROC 0.833, AUC-PR 0.856**, outperforming all baselines.
- **Feature Importance**:
  - **Hypertension, anxiety, and depression were key predictors** of AD progression.
  - **Bidirectional modeling allowed the AI to learn from past medical events**, improving long-term predictive accuracy.
- **Comparison with Traditional ML**:
  - **BiGRU consistently outperformed LGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression**, especially in longer prediction windows.

### Implications
We demonstrate that **deep learning models applied to longitudinal claims data can significantly improve early detection of Alzheimer’s disease risk**. These findings support:
- **Scalable, real-world applications of AI in dementia prediction**, without requiring expensive neuroimaging or genetic biomarkers.
- **Improved clinical decision-making**, enabling **early intervention for high-risk MCI patients**.
- **Personalized risk stratification for dementia prevention**, facilitating **targeted monitoring and interventions**.

### Future Work
- **Integrating social determinants of health (SDoH) data** to enhance predictive accuracy.
- **Exploring multimodal AI approaches** combining claims data with **clinical notes and neuroimaging**.
- **Validating the model across diverse patient populations** to ensure **robust generalizability**.
