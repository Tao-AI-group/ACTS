    "content": "Clinical trial meta data modelingWe have conducted a comprehensive exploration of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) related clinical trials, identifying a total of 3,416 trials. The United States leads with 1,787 trials, followed by France (287) and China (139), reflecting both significant global involvement and regional concentration. We observed that the number of AD-related trials has generally increased over time, peaking with 265 trials in 2023. A majority (79.8%) of these trials are interventional, primarily focusing on drug interventions, with 20.0% being observational studies. We also analyzed the distribution across trial phases, noting that 34.0% of the trials are not phase-specific. From a manual review of 50 selected trials, we identified common formats for outcome measurements, which include efficacy assessments through cognition tests, imaging scans, and various safety and tolerability metrics. Treatment strategies typically involve combinations of experimental drugs with active and placebo comparators, while treatment assignment is organized into randomized and non-randomized models. Follow-up periods are defined by the patient’s first AD diagnosis, loss to follow-up, or a specified time after the baseline measurement. Moving forward, we plan to analyze additional trials to extract and standardize common elements, which will contribute to the development of an AD-related ontology using the Athena OHDSI vocabulary.Publication:  Hu X, Sun Z, Nian Y, Wang Y, Dang Y, Li F, Feng J, Yu E, Tao C.

    "content": "We have developed an ontology for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) common data elements, which were collected from AD-related clinical trial eligibility criteria. This ontology encompasses a range of the most common data elements including disease, medication, lab test results, procedures, rating criteria, social determinants of health, and fertility. Each element was normalized to the UMLS terminology and the OHDSI Standardized Vocabularies. The social determinants of health and fertility type entities are not yet fully established. Furthermore, we leveraged the hierarchy of Disease Ontology to form the structure of disease-type entities, the class definition from Drug Bank and the OHDSI Standardized Vocabularies to create the structure of medication-type entities, and the grouping method from LOINC to form lab test entities. The remaining structures were referring to the OHDSI Standardized Vocabularies. Moreover, we annotated the phenotyping algorithms and related value sets sourced from NLM Value Set Authority Center, NDC List, UMLS Terminology, Codify by AAPC, and Phenotype KnowledgeBase. This standardized ontology could be served for various downstream tasks, such as helping design new trials.Publication:  Sun Z, Tao C.
