# **ACTS: AD Clinical Trial Simulation**
Developing Advanced Informatics Approaches for an Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trial Simulation System

This is a multiple primary investigator project funded by NIH. Teams at Mayo Clinic, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and University of Florida
collaborate in bringing in an innovated tool to simulate clincal trial for Alzheimer's disease (AD).This project is led by Dr.Cui Tao (Mayo Clinic), Dr. GQ Zhang (UTHealth), and Dr. Jiang Bian (UF).
