# **ACTS: AD Clinical Trial Simulation**
Developing Advanced Informatics Approaches for an Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trial Simulation System

This is a multiple primary investigator project funded by NIH. Teams at Mayo Clinic, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and **Indiana University** collaborate in bringing in an innovated tool to simulate **clinical** trial for Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). This project is led by Dr. Cui Tao (Mayo Clinic), Dr. GQ Zhang (UTHealth), and Dr. Jiang Bian (**IU**).

### Update
- AD ontology development progresses with TF-IDF analysis, expansion of Medication, Procedure, and Disease entities, and pending SDoH ontology integration using LLM-based methods. Real-world clinical trial replication continues with annotation guideline revisions, SQL query construction, and evaluation via reverse engineering. OMOP to MongoDB conversion advances, with query export to JSON completed, and discussions on dataset selection ongoing. (Mar 5, 2025)  
- AD ontology expansion continues with TF-IDF analysis, Athena ID annotation, and SDoH ontology integration using LLM-based methods. Real-world clinical trial replication progresses with annotation, SQL queries in EHR, and evaluation using reverse engineering approaches. Efforts to convert OMOP to MongoDB are ongoing, with discussions on embedding ontology in queries and optimizing query performance for real-world applications. (Feb 19, 2025)  
- The AD ontology continues to expand, incorporating SDoH concepts with LLM-based approaches and refining ontology coverage using TF-IDF analysis. Real-world clinical trial replication efforts progress with cohort building and clinical criteria annotation, while OMOP CDM data conversion faces format challenges and awaits PI decisions on missing data imports. The web interface and patient matching workflows are being refined, with ongoing collaboration between UF and Mayo for database validation and clinical trial integration. (Jan 22, 2025)  
- AD ontology expansion continues with SDoH ontology integration and evaluation of ontology coverage using TF-IDF. The real-world clinical trial replication is progressing, with preliminary cohort building and data standardization underway. OMOP CDM data conversion faces format challenges, and discussions are ongoing regarding missing RAW_* columns. (Dec 18, 2024)  
- AD ontology expansion, real-world clinical trial replication, and OMOP CDM data conversion ongoing, SDoH ontology integration, and clinical trial metadata ontology updates in progress (Nov 20, 2024)  
- AD ontology updates and metadata ontology development ongoing, with integration into OMOP CDM pipeline in progress, AD ontology refinement, real-world clinical trial replication, and database conversion to OMOP CDM in progress (Oct 2, 2024)
